# micronuclAI: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write this documentation describing your workflow's output -->

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [Segmentation](#segmentation) - perform cell segmentation based on provided nuclear image.
- [MicronuclAI](#micronuclai) - detect micronuclei based on image and segmentation mask
- [MultiQC](#multiqc) - Aggregate report describing results and QC from the whole pipeline
- [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

### Segmentation

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `segmentation/`
  - `cellpose/`
    - `*_cellpose_mask.tif`: Segmentation mask created by [Cellpose](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01018-x) if selected.
  - `stardist/`
    - `*_stardist_mask.tif`: Segmentation mask created by [Stardist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist) if selected.
  - `mesmer/`
    - `*_mesmer_mask.tif`: Segmentation mask created by [Deepcell Mesmer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-01094-0) if selected.

</details>

In the case that precomputed segmentation masks are not provided, segmentation tools produce a labeled segmentation mask based on the nuclear image values.
Selection of tools includes [Stardist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist), [Cellpose](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01018-x), and [Deepcell Mesmer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-01094-0), all of which come with pretrained models.

:::note
Depending on which segmentation method is selected with the `segmentation_method` parameter, the respective outputs are provided. If a segmentation mask is provided in the input, segmentation is skipped.

### MicronuclAI

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `micronuclai/`
  - `*_predictions.csv`: A `csv` file containing cell label information in the `image` column, the predicted score by the model in the `score` column, and the prediction for number of micronuclei found per cell in the `micronuclei` column
  - `*_summary.csv`: A `csv` file containing a summary of detected micronuclei metrics - count per number of micronuclei, number of total cells, number of total micronuclei, number of cells with micronuclei, proportion of cells with micronuclei, ratio of total micronuclei counts with the number of cells.

</details>

[micronuclAI](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.24.595722v1.full.pdf) is a tool to predict the number of micronuclei in high-resolution microscopy images based on single-cell crops extracted with the help of segmentation masks. Predictions are done by a pre-trained convolutional neural network model.

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.
  - Parameters used by the pipeline run: `params.json`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
